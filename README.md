Hadum is a student assistant app that helps students with their daily tasks in school.

With Hadum you can add, save and delete lists of your to-dos, take a note üìù, add and view lists of your events, calculate and save your GPA and CGPA, you also get a break down of your CGPA (GPA of each semester). I also believe that most people like keeping information about their CGPA a secret, and that's why I added an authentication feature, i.e you have to confirm your registration number before you can view your results (GPA's and CGPA).

With Hadum you can also add, view and delete your lecture timetable. This means you can access it any where you are as long as you are with your phone.

Hadum also enables you access and navigate the school website easily and fast with just one click on your phone. You also get the beautiful feel of the website with little animations on your phone.

I believe that we owe our brain the responsibility of engaging it in an intellectual activity regular, and that was why I also incorporated quiz into the app, where you get tested on politics, sports, geography, religion, technology etc. You also can get motivated to play more by trying to beat your highest record which is shown in the app.
